Executables examined using Ghidra

0x00 Password found in main; 250382
0x01 Password is int 0x149a, or decimal 5274
0x02 Password is 0x52b24, or decimal 338724
0x03 Password is the same as in 0x02
0x04 Password needs to sum to 0xf, or 15, I used 69
0x05 Password need to sum to 0x10, and needs to & with 1 to equal 0; 88 works, as does 4444
0x06 Takes an environment char** _Env; Environment variable is LOL, set LOL=b1h0, then use password from 0x05
0x07 Looks like symbols are stripped off; Look for decompile function block that most resembles main, then trace control backwards; same solution as 0x06
